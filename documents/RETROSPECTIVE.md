# Schrodingers-9 Library

## Retrospective

Looking back, one aspect of the project that was not as successful as we would have hoped, was the ‘Order Books’/'Checkout' feature. Due to its high priority, and being an integral part to our idea, we planned to have the order books feature ready for an earlier iteration. However, since the 'Checkout' feature depended upon many other parts of the system like: Account Management (especially billing information), the Shopping Cart, as well as the final database implementation - due to these reasons, the 'Checkout' feature was inevitably delayed. Over estimation of our developer tasks when combined with the 'Checkout' feature's dependencies on other areas of the project, further amplified delay of the 'Checkout' feature. For these reasons, the feature was moved/completed in the last iteration (aka iteration 3).  

The team also suffered from both inexperience with Git, as well as communication issues for the first two iterations. To remedy this, the team was encouraged to speak/post more through communication mediums (like Google Hangouts, Google Docs/Google Drive, and Slack) and to be less afraid when pushing changes to the 'master' branch of the application. The team also implemented a routine where each group member would pick the user story in which they are most comfortable implementing. This helped to evenly distribute the work-load and smooth-out the project velocity.

For iteration 1, it is evident that we underestimated our coding abilities. However, by iteration 2, the team's estimation of their coding ability had become more accurate. The project velocity helped to balance the overall workload amoungst the team members, and ultimately helped to gauge each member's experience with Android Studio IDE as well as their own individual coding velocity. This feedback was useful in assigning and distributing work throughout the later iterations. For reference, the project velocity chart [(link)](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2019/schrodingers-library/blob/master/documents/Project_velocity.png) provides in-depth look into the team's performance over the past three iterations. 

Due to such a short sample period (when looking at both iterations 1 and 2), the team appears to have an inconsistent pattern. Our planned time for both iterations 1 and 2 were both higher than the Actual Time needed to develop them. This explains the lack of experience with the Android Studio IDE, the Git software, and readjustment of work between the team members. The project velocity helped in later iterations to understand each members work-flow and facilitated greater communication between the team members. 

Over the past 3 iterations, the team has learned much about the Android Studio IDE, Git version control, and each other's coding styles. This has been an immense learning experience of which we are grateful to be a part of.
