# Schrodingers-9 Library

## Vision Statement

Schrodinger's Library is a book ordering system which allows ordinary people to browse for books they are interested in, as well as purchase and order them. It will provide a catalogue with a large variety of books to choose from, offering an experience similar to shopping at a bookstore.

The service is designed for anyone who wants the ease of purchasing a book without going to the bookstore physically to browse and buy a book. It will allow customers to create an account (optional), browse for books, or view the book’s information such as synopsis, author, price, genre and year of publish. Customers who have an account should also be able to purchase, rate, and add desired books to their wishlist.

Our typical visitors would be the people with the intention to purchase a specific book, and our casual users will be the people who do not necessarily have an account with us, but use our service as an advantage to browse for desired books but with no intention of actually purchasing them.

Both types of customers will have access to various parts of the system and be able to fulfill their intentions like looking for a specific book, browsing through various books on display, or viewing a book’s information. The difference is that customers with an account will be able to purchase the book, rate/review it if they choose to, as well as add it to their wishlist. Customers who have created an account will also have access to view their purchase history, save and edit payment information, and view their currently owned books. 

Since the application will present different details about the books on display, it will need to maintain information about each book like the book’s title, the author’s name, and the genre. Such information will be required in order to properly add an entry of the book to the system.The system will also require security features for certain users, especially those who have created an account and/or stored their banking information.

Schrodinger’s Library is envisioned to be an Android app, which will be accessible via the Google Play Store or a standard web browser. Our system will improve upon current designs by providing a simple, flexible, and streamlined interface. It will focus on being free of clutter, making it accessible on most portable devices. 

The project will be considered successful if: 

 a) a new customer can find, select, and order their book in under 10 clicks/taps.
 
 b) current customers express above 60% satisfaction or preference over similar systems when polled/surveyed after making a purchase.

If both a) and b) are accomplished, we will consider our system a success.
