# Schrodingers Library Website
*powered by Hugo*

## Instructions

 - To edit the Hugo files go to `/schrodingers-hugo` and follow the instructions
 - To open the builded website go to `/public` and open `index.html`
 - ADVICE: files in `public` may act weird because of Hugo rendering for hosting and not locally. If experiencing any issues please follow the instructions in `schrodingers-hugo` to launch it. But public the majority of files work good in public
