text: "Also a third year Computer Science student. Love robots, videogames, traveling and music. I have learned a lot about tools and techniques to become a good software engineer and programmer overall. I really enjoyed programming in Android, althought it was a very new and scary field at the beginning for me. Also, I meet awesome people and practiced teamwork after a while."
