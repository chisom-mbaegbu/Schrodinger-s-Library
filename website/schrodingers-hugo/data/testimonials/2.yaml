text: "Third year computer science major with a minor in statistics. Enjoys cooking, travelling and hanging out with friends. Had fun working on this project from getting to work with others and then, to using the Android studio for the first time. Communicating with my team members initially was terrifying but we got to know each other and there’s no doubt that I ‘ve got the best teammates. I gained experience working with Git, Mockito, etc. and most especially, I developed my testing and debugging skills. What an experience!"
