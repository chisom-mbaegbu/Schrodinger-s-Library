After almost 4 months of development, we gathered and talked about everything done and not done. These are some of the ideas discussed:

## What do we thing about the architecture of our system?
A 3-tier-architecture was very comfortable for us. It is very easy to learn, and the work flow was very

## What went wrong in the development process?
We lacked of communication in the first months of this project. That was the key to some delays in our development process. We were also pretty new in Android Development, so learning it meant a delay in our initial work

## What went right in the development process?
Although of all miscommunications, we managed to have a decent working system for each iteration. We were very lucky to have hard working teammates and with different skills.

## What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?
What took the most time was learning all the tools! mostly all of the Android Studio stuff. Also database implementation and integration/system tests

## Did any features work better than expected?
We are actually glad that the whole app works (and looks) very good!

## Improvements after Iteration 2
More work done, not overestimating of our time and not underestimating of our skills. Better communication and better looking result

## What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?
Spend more time knowing our teammates is important to perform good as a team. Also, there should be more focus on the most important parts of the project. Knowing and using an architecture, all the techniques and design patterns help a lot to make the code more readable and easy to maintain, so we should spend more time learning and understanding all of those.
