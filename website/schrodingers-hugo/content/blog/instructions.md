After installing Schrodingers Library, you will be able to browse through our catalog. If you are looking for a specific book, search for the book with the use of the search bar.
We won't force you to create an account with us if you only want to see the books available and their ratings, but you can create an account if you would like to use our app at its full potential. This will allow you to order books, have a purchase history, wishlist and be able to rate/submit a review for a book.
To create an account go to *My account* in the main menu, and then *Create an account* by filling out the information required and you are done!
Before purchasing a book please double check if your payment and address are updated. You can do that through the checkout or *My Account*.
If you would like to get some book recommendations, go to the *Book recommendations* option in the main menu.
