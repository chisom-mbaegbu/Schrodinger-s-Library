      <description>Schrodinger&amp;rsquo;s Library is a book ordering system which allows ordinary people to browse for books they are interested in, as well as purchase and order them. It will provide a catalogue with a large variety of books to choose from, offering an experience similar to shopping at a bookstore.
The service is designed for anyone who wants the ease of purchasing a book without going to the bookstore physically to browse and buy a book.</description>
